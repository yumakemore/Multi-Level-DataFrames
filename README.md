# Multi-Level-DataFrames

In data ETL using Python Pandas, programming is often hindered by ad hoc coding for appending, adding, or inserting a single row or column into a DataFrame. This is pronounced when the DataFrame has multi-level row and column indices. On the other hand, dropping. removing, deleting a single row or column from a DataFrame is easy and does not incur any delay in the development.

This repository contains two reusable functions - one for appending/adding/inserting a row; the other for appending/adding/inserting a column. The provided functions can be simply copied into any development project and conveniently used by the developers. The functions support multi-level-indexed DataFrames.

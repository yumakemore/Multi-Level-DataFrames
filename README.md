# Multi-Level-DataFrames

In data ETL using Python Pandas, the programming is often hindered by the ad hoc coding for appending, adding, or inserting a single row or column into a Pandas DataFrame. This is pronounced when the DataFrame has multi-level index and multi-level columns. On the other hand, dropping. removing, deleting a single row or column from a DataFrame is easy and does not incur any delay in the development.
This project provides two reusable functions - one for appending/adding/inserting a row into a DataFrame; the other for appending/adding/inserting a column into a DataFrame. The provided functions can be simply copied into any development project and conveniently used by the developers. The functions support multi-level and multi-columns DataFrames.
